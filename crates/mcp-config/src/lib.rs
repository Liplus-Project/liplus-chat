//! Registering the room sidecar in a project's `.mcp.json`, and the flag
//! guard that keeps a launched session able to receive channel pushes.
//!
//! Both are conditions the round trip does not survive without (see the
//! 成立条件 in `docs/0-requirements.md`):
//!
//!   - The sidecar must be registered **by name**. A config handed over with
//!     `--mcp-config` does not resolve on the channel side.
//!   - The launch must carry `--dangerously-load-development-channels
//!     server:<name>` and nothing else on that axis. Adding `--channels`
//!     registers the same server twice and takes the whole room down.
//!
//! This crate holds no tauri: it writes into the user's own project directory,
//! which is the part of liplus-chat that most needs test coverage, and a test
//! binary linking the tauri tree does not load on the GNU target.
